# Project 5: Deep Learning 
## Applied Deep Learning on NLP

### Install

This project requires **Python 2.7** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)

### Code

There are 3 python files `model1.py`, `model2.py` and `vis.py`. Model 1 and Model 2 contain two different deep learning models implemented in Tensorflow. `vis.py` contains visulaization code for the data. `project5.pdf` contains project report.

### Run

In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `deep_learning/` (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

```python model1.py```  
```python model2.py``` 

This will run both deep learning models. But run one deep learning model at a time because it is computationally very expensive.

### Data

The dataset used in this project is Large Movie Review Dataset. You have to download it separately [Large Movie Review Dataset](http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/). You will also need to download [Glove Vectors 50 dimiensional](http://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/). The unzipped files of the dataset and glove vectors should be in same folder that contains this README.
